# Image Classification

Image Classification is the easiest of all the tasks and involves classifying an image into one of a set of predefined classes.

The output of an image classifier is a single class label and a confidence score. Image classification is useful when you need to know only what class an image belongs to and don't need to know where the objects of that class are located, what their exact shape is or whether it belongs to multiple classes or not.
